# Define the main function
def main():
    # Create a string 'book_name' containing a book title in lowercase
    book_name = 'the house of silk'

    # Use the 'capitalize()' method to capitalize the first letter of the string
    capitalized_book_name = book_name.capitalize()

    # Print the capitalized book title
    print(capitalized_book_name)

# Check if this script is the main entry point
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Call the 'main' function if this script is being run directly
    main()

# The expected output: The book title with the first letter capitalized
