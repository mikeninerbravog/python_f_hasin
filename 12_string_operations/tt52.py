# Define the main function
def main():
    # Create a string 'book_name' containing a book title
    book_name = "alice's adventures in wonderland"

    # Use the 'title()' method to capitalize the first letter of each word in the string
    # and print the result
    print(book_name.title())

# Check if this script is the main entry point
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Call the 'main' function if this script is being run directly
    main()

# The expected output: The input book title with each word's first letter capitalized
# Alice'S Adventures In Wonderland
