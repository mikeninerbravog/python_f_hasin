# Define the main function
def main():
    # Create a list called 'random_numbers' containing various integers
    random_numbers = [6, 1, 3, 8, 0, 9, 12, 3, 4, 0, 54, 8, 100, 55, 60, 70, 85]

    # Use a 'for' loop to iterate over each 'number' in the 'random_numbers' list
    for number in random_numbers:
        # Print the current 'number'
        print(number)


# Check if this script is the main entry point
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Call the 'main' function if this script is being run directly
    main()

# The expected output: All the numbers in the 'random_numbers' list printed one by one
# 6
# 1
# 3
# 8
# 0
# 9
# 12
# 3
# 4
# 0
# 54
# 8
# 100
# 55
