"""
Explanation of the error:

The variable message is declared within the outside() function scope, and it is not accessible outside that function. 
In the main() function, you're trying to print the value of the message variable, but it's not defined within the 
main() function or its surrounding scope. This leads to a NameError because Python doesn't know what message is. To 
fix this error, you need to declare the message variable in a scope that is accessible to both the outside() and 
main() functions, or pass the value of message from one function to the other.
