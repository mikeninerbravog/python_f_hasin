# Define the main function
def main():
    # Create a list 'books' containing book titles
    books = ['Dracula', 'Frankenstein', 'The Omen', 'The Exorcist', 'The Legend of Sleepy Hollow']

    # Multiply the 'books' list by 2 using the '*' operator
    duplicated_books = books * 2

    # Print the list containing duplicated book titles
    print(duplicated_books)

# Check if this script is the main entry point
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Call the 'main' function if this script is being run directly
    main()

# The expected output: The 'books' list duplicated twice in the output
